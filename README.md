- 👋 Hi, I’m @Dawnwit
- 👀 I’m interested in Python and AI
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python basics
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a project that's been pushing me to new areas. A way to help normal users understand techno and the trade off being made without much public discussion. I loop of ignorance that let's tech giants to hide unfair deals within terms and conditions, permissions through application, and hiding from responsibility with a digital shield.
- 📫 How to reach me @ donwidd@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: him, he, his, they, them
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm not very code savvy but my general knowledge helps me with AI logic. Logic comes easy enough,so I have naive hope!
